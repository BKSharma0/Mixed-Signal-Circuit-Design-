# Design of Charge Pump with Low Current-Mismatch and Low Glitches
# PLL
PLL is closed loop negative feedback system which maintains same phase as the reference signal.
It is used in signal synchronization, communication systems.
# Use of Charge Pump 
It is a type of DC-DC converter which uses capacitors to store charge through which it either raises or lowers the voltage levels
Charge Pumps are very important components in the PLL(Phase Lock Loop).
It is used in PLL to convert the error signal generated by the PFD(Phase Frequency Detector) to it’s equivalent  Control voltage which controls the frequency of the VCO.
# Working of CP
A Charge Pump  converts the digital UP and DOWN control signals (generated by the Phase-Frequency Detector) into analog currents. These currents are then integrated by the Loop Filter to generate the control
voltage for the VCO.

# Project Design: Visual Asset and Device Calculations



## Given specifications

- `µn * Cox = 200 µA/V² = 200e-6 A/V²`  
- `µp * Cox = 80 µA/V²  = 80e-6 A/V²`  
- `V_ov = 0.25 V`  
- `W_n = 120 nm`  
- `W_p = 480 nm`  
- `L   = 45 nm`

---

## 1) Width-to-length ratios

- `(W/L)_n = 120 / 45 = 2.6666667`  
- `(W/L)_p = 480 / 45 = 10.6666667`

---

## 2) Saturation current formula (square-law approximation)

We use the simplified (long-channel) saturation expression:
### NMOS arithmetic (step-by-step)

1. `V_ov^2 = (0.25)^2 = 0.0625`  
2. `µn C_ox * (W/L)_n = 200e-6 * 2.6666667 = 5.3333334e-4 A/V²`  
3. multiply by `V_ov^2`: `5.3333334e-4 * 0.0625 = 3.333333375e-5 A`  
4. apply 1/2:  
   `I_D_n = 0.5 * 3.333333375e-5 = 1.6666666875e-5 A ≈ 16.67 µA`

### PMOS arithmetic (step-by-step)

1. `µp C_ox * (W/L)_p = 80e-6 * 10.6666667 = 8.53333336e-4 A/V²`  
2. multiply by `V_ov^2`: `8.53333336e-4 * 0.0625 = 5.33333335e-5 A`  
3. apply 1/2:  
   `I_D_p = 0.5 * 5.33333335e-5 = 2.666666675e-5 A ≈ 26.67 µA`

---

## 3) Small-signal approximate `R_on`

Use the linearized approximation around the operating point:


### NMOS

- Denominator: `200e-6 * 2.6666667 * 0.25 = 1.33333335e-4 A/V`  
- `R_on,n ≈ 1 / 1.33333335e-4 ≈ 7_500 Ω` (≈ 7.5 kΩ)

### PMOS

- Denominator: `80e-6 * 10.6666667 * 0.25 = 2.13333334e-4 A/V`  
- `R_on,p ≈ 1 / 2.13333334e-4 ≈ 4_687.5 Ω` (≈ 4.6875 kΩ)

---

## 4) Final numeric summary

- `I_D,n ≈ 16.67 µA`  
- `I_D,p ≈ 26.67 µA`  
- `R_on,n ≈ 7.5 kΩ`  
- `R_on,p ≈ 4.6875 kΩ`

## Applications of the Charge Pump

A charge pump that provides low current-mismatch and stable charge transfer is useful in many mixed-signal and power-management contexts. Typical applications include:

- **On-chip voltage generation (boost/negative rails):** Generate higher (e.g., 2×/3×) or negative supply voltages from a single supply for gate drivers, EEPROM/Flash programming, or bias networks.

- **Bias generation for analog blocks:** Create stable internal bias rails (substrate, well, reference biases) for op-amps, comparators, and ADCs where matching and low mismatch matter.

- **Level shifters and gate drivers:** Drive transistors whose gates require voltages beyond the core supply (e.g., high-side/low-side drivers in power stages).

- **On-chip DC-DC conversion for ultra-low-power systems:** Replace an external regulator in energy-harvesting or sensor nodes where area and quiescent current are critical.

- **PLL/VCO tuning and supply:** Provide local supply or bias voltages for RF blocks, phase-locked loops, and voltage-controlled oscillators.
