# Design of Charge Pump with Low Current-Mismatch and Low Glitches
# PLL
PLL is closed loop negative feedback system which maintains same phase as the reference signal.
It is used in signal synchronization, communication systems.
# Use of Charge Pump 
It is a type of DC-DC converter which uses capacitors to store charge through which it either raises or lowers the voltage levels
Charge Pumps are very important components in the PLL(Phase Lock Loop).
It is used in PLL to convert the error signal generated by the PFD(Phase Frequency Detector) to it’s equivalent  Control voltage which controls the frequency of the VCO.
# Working of CP
A Charge Pump  converts the digital UP and DOWN control signals (generated by the Phase-Frequency Detector) into analog currents. These currents are then integrated by the Loop Filter to generate the control
voltage for the VCO.

##  Improved Charge Pump With Error Amplifier

To address mismatch, an improved charge pump uses:

- A **high-gain error amplifier**  
- Feedback loop to force **I_up = I_down**  
- Better steady-state behavior  
- Lower phase error  
- Reduced mismatch compared to the traditional design  

However, leakage-induced phase error and ripple remain challenges.

##  Differential Charge Pump With Reference Voltage

A more advanced architecture employs a **fully differential charge pump**, designed to:

### ✔ Cancel leakage-induced phase error
Leakage affects both differential outputs equally → differential subtraction removes it.

### ✔ Improve current matching
Using fully symmetrical pull-up and pull-down paths.

### ✔ Achieve wider output voltage swing
Suitable for low-voltage and high-frequency designs.

### ✔ Reduce glitches and switching noise
Through source-side switching and precharge circuitry.

### ✔ Stabilize the output voltage
Using a **reference-voltage follower** plus a protection network to prevent back-injection.

### ✔ Produce stable output without spurious jumps
Critical for high-speed PLL acquisition and locking.

This architecture meets the needs of high-speed communication systems where even small VCO voltage fluctuations can severely affect output frequency.
